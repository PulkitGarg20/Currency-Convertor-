# Currency-Convertor-

This project is a Currency Converter web application that allows users to convert currency values from one currency to another in real time. The application uses a reliable API to fetch real-time exchange rates and displays the conversion results on the user interface. The app supports multiple currencies and includes flags to represent each currency for a more visually appealing experience. The core technologies used in this project are HTML for structuring the webpage, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle the functionality and API requests. The CurrencyAPI is used to fetch the latest exchange rates and provide accurate conversions based on the userâ€™s input.

To use the currency converter, simply open the index.html file in your browser. Enter the amount you wish to convert, select the source currency (from) and the target currency (to) from the dropdown menus, and click the "Get Exchange Rate" button to see the conversion. If there are any issues with the conversion or API fetching, users are encouraged to check their internet connection or verify the API key used in the script file.

The application relies on CurrencyAPI for real-time exchange rates. To use it, you must have an API key, which can be obtained by signing up at CurrencyAPI. The conversion feature fetches data via a secure API endpoint, ensuring the accuracy and up-to-date nature of the exchange rates displayed.
